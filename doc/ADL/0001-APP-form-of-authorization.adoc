= 1. APP - decision on the form of authorization

Date: 06-10-2021

== Status

Accepted

== Context

- I have an app written in Java using Spring Framework.
- To allow users to log in we have to choose the form of security.
- I want a solution that will be easy to use and developed by external company to avoid security breaches because I don't have much experience with security details.
- The chosen form should allow web app to authenticate.

== Decision

Status: accepted

I will use Okta as authorization provider and use OAuth2/OpenID Connect to secure the backend application.

Date: 06-10-2021

== Consequences

- The data of the users will not be on my server, and I have a limit on number of users on free tier.
- The security will be much easier to implement because of the existing libraries.

== Other options

- security implemented by me - require higher skills and more knowledge
- other OAuth providers (Google, Facebook) - users need to have an account in given provider
